# README LAB

## Description

A command-line app that dynamically generates a professional README.md file

## Installation

Click "<> code" - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. 

Detailed information about [cloning a repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

You will also need to download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

And NPM, that you can install running the code below in your terminal:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Within the directory of this app, install Inquirer by using the command:

```bash
npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0
```

**Make sure to download this version, because the newest ones does not use the commonjs syntax require('inquirer') anymore.**

## Mock-Up

The following gif shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Usage/Examples

Initialize the app by typing the command "node index.js" in your terminal. Once the app is initialized,  series of questions will appear so that the user can insert the necessary information to build the file.

A new README file will be then generated and saved into a different folder.
