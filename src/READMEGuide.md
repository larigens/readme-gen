## Installation

Please provide a detailed description of the steps needed to install and set up your project.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Screenshots and example usage are helpful here! 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository then upload your screenshot there. Then, using the relative filepath - start with "assets/" followed by path to image. Example:

    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

If passwords or usernames are required for your project, please include them in this section.

## Credits

This is a way to show your appreciation and help other readers get the original edition.

Personally, I like to separate this point into two:

### Acknowledgements

Include a list of any third-party assets that require attribution. Include the names of their creators, along with links to relevant web presences for those individuals. If you followed tutorials on the creation process and wish to credit them, include links in this section as well.

### Authors

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

## License

One of the last sections in a high-quality README file should be your license. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [LICENSE](https://choosealicense.com/).

The sections discussed above are the core elements of your project; however, you may want to consider including additional items such as:
## Badges

![README Lab](https://img.shields.io/badge/README%20Lab-%F0%9F%92%99-9cf)

Although badges are not technically necessary, they do help you build credibility in the eyes of other developers. Check out the badges hosted by [Shields](https://shields.io/).

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute, include guidelines for how they can do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Writing tests will demonstrate that you have thoroughly tested your application. This shows confidence in the final result and provides an assurance of functionality to others who might rely on it. Provide examples on how to run them here.
